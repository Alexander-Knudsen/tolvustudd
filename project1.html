      <!-- Project Description -->
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project involved creating a personal portfolio website to showcase my work and achievements. Leveraging my background in website development as a hobby, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub to build and manage the site. I started with an existing site template that I had previously developed with assistance from ChatGPT, which provided a solid foundation for customization tailored to the course requirements.
