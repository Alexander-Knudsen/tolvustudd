      <h1>Project 2: Press-Fit Design & Vinyl Cutting</h1>

      <h2>üìå Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project focused on designing and fabricating a **press-fit assembly** using **Fusion 360, Inkscape, and a laser cutter**.
        I also used a **vinyl cutter** to create a separate design. The goal was to learn **parametric modeling, kerf compensation, and laser cutting techniques**.
      </p>

      <h2>üìå Parametric Design</h2>
<p>
  This project was designed with <strong>full parametric control</strong> in Fusion 360, allowing for quick adjustments to key values such as <strong>material thickness, slot dimensions, and joint types</strong>. This approach ensured that the design could be <strong>easily modified without redrawing anything</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Below are the main parameters that controlled the model:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Thickness</strong></td>
    <td>3 mm</td>
    <td>Material thickness used for cutting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Width</strong></td>
    <td>150 mm</td>
    <td>Total width of the base shape.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Height</strong></td>
    <td>100 mm</td>
    <td>Total height of the base shape.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>FilletRadius_slot</strong></td>
    <td>Fillet - 0.1 mm</td>
    <td>Rounded corners for smoother slot insertion.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>SlotWidth</strong></td>
    <td>Thickness - 0.1 mm (2.90 mm)</td>
    <td>Width of the slots for press-fit connection, adjusted for kerf.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>SlotLength</strong></td>
    <td>25 mm</td>
    <td>Depth of each slot for secure fit.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>T_Width_Slot</strong></td>
    <td>T_Width - 0.1 mm (4.90 mm)</td>
    <td>Width of the T-slot, adjusted for kerf.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>T_Height_Slot</strong></td>
    <td>T_Height - 0.1 mm (2.90 mm)</td>
    <td>Height of the T-slot, adjusted for kerf.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>T_Height</strong></td>
    <td>3 mm</td>
    <td>Full height of the T-tab.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>T_Width</strong></td>
    <td>5 mm</td>
    <td>Full width of the T-tab.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Fillet</strong></td>
    <td>1 mm</td>
    <td>General fillet applied to edges.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The use of <strong>parametric values</strong> allowed for <strong>easy adjustments</strong> if any fitment issues arose during testing. For example, the slot width was reduced slightly (<code>Thickness - 0.1 mm</code>) to ensure a tight press-fit after accounting for <strong>kerf from the laser cutter</strong>. The T-joints were also parametrically controlled so that they could be modified for better interlocking strength.

      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Laser Cutting & Testing</h2>
<p>
  Once the design was finalized in <strong>Fusion 360</strong>, I exported it as <strong>DXF and SVG</strong> and prepared it for <strong>laser cutting</strong>.
  Since precise <strong>press-fit connections</strong> require tight tolerances, I made sure to apply <strong>kerf compensation</strong> in Inkscape to avoid loose joints.
</p>

<p>
  During the cutting process, I closely monitored the <strong>laser settings</strong>, ensuring that the <strong>power (100%) and speed (30%) were optimized</strong> for clean edges.
  I ran a <strong>small test cut first</strong>, measuring the slot widths with calipers to confirm that the material removal (kerf) was consistent
  with my calculations. The first test piece was slightly loose, so I adjusted the <strong>SlotWidth parameter in Fusion 360</strong> before cutting the final version.
</p>

<p>
  The laser cutter performed well, but I noticed that <strong>heat buildup caused minor edge darkening</strong>. To minimize this, I adjusted the
  cutting speed slightly and ensured that the <strong>air assist was functioning properly</strong>. Once the final cut was complete, I manually
  checked each slot by inserting the tabs and confirming that the <strong>press-fit held securely without excessive force</strong>.
</p>




      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Assembly & Fit Testing</h2>
<p>
  For this project, I wanted to keep the design <strong>simple and functional</strong> while still having a bit of an <strong>aesthetic touch</strong>.
  The goal was to create something that would be <strong>easy to assemble</strong> but also look good as a finished piece because sometimes less is more.
</p>

<p>
  The design included <strong>three different press-fit joint types</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic Slot:</strong> Standard press-fit connection.</li>
  <li><strong>T-Slot:</strong> Provides extra locking to prevent movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Rounded Slot:</strong> Allows easier insertion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  After cutting, I tested how well the pieces fit together. The first version was slightly loose, so I adjusted the slot width by <strong>-0.05mm</strong> to get a tighter fit.
  The final assembly came out well, and I ended up <strong>mounting the piece on my wall</strong> as part of my setup.
</p>

<p>
  Originally, I planned to use my <strong>dad‚Äôs pen plotter</strong> to add some artwork to the design, but the plotter wasn‚Äôt working.
  I‚Äôll revisit this later to add some decorative elements to the piece.

      <h2>üé® Vinyl Cutter Project</h2>
<p>
  In addition to laser cutting, I also used a <strong>vinyl cutter</strong> to create a separate design in Inkscape.
  The design was converted into an <strong>SVG</strong>, then sent to the vinyl cutter for processing.
</p>

<p>
  For the design, I wanted something <strong>recognizable and nostalgic</strong>, so I thought of the <strong>DC Shoes logo</strong>.
  Pretty much <strong>everyone had some clothing from DC Shoes as a kid</strong>, so it felt like a fun and familiar choice for the vinyl cut.

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Challenge</th>
          <th>Solution</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Slots were too loose after the first cut</td>
          <td>Adjusted **SlotWidth** in Fusion 360 and used "Inset" in Inkscape to compensate for kerf.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>T-Slot was too tight for easy assembly</td>
          <td>Reduced **TabWidth** slightly to allow a better fit.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Using Inkscape, laser cutter, and vinyl cutter for the first time</td>
          <td>Read about how to use, ask chatGPT and learn by doing</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h2>üí° Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>**Kerf compensation is critical**‚Äîeven small adjustments affect fit.</li>
        <li>**Parametric modeling saves time**‚Äîadjusting a few values improved the design without starting over.</li>
        <li>**Test cuts are essential**‚ÄîI had to iterate before getting a perfect fit.</li>
